# SampleApi
SampleApi is rest api written in .NET Core.  

Project is divided into several layers:

## Sample.Api
Presentation layer. Includes Controllers, DTOs
#### DTO - *data transfer object*
Classes using for input or output in controllers. For its filling from Domain entities (loaded by application or infrastructure layer) is used NuGet **AutoMapper**.
## Sample.Application
Application layer. Contains business logic.
## Sample.Domain
Core of application. It contains Entities (Base application data classes).
It contains plain objects and logic that is applicable in general to the whole entity.. 
## Sample.Infrastructure
- Retrieve and store data from and to a number of sources (database, network devices, file system, 3rd parties, and so on.  
- Define interfaces for the data that they need in order to apply some logic. One or more data providers will implement the interface, but the use case doesnâ€™t know where the data is coming from.
- Implements this interfaces (Repositories)
### Database
The application uses ORM (Object Relational Mapping) **EntityFramework** for accessing and managing database. Database model and data init seed to tables is provided by EntityFramework migrations. 
## Testing
For testing is used xUnit. 
#### Arrange
For data mocking is used NuGet **Moq**.
#### Assert
For asserting is used NuGet **FluentAssertions**.

## Setup and start the application

### Creating database model and seed initial data
From a Package Manager Console in Visual Studio call command:  
<Code>Update-Database</Code>  
Default project must be set to **Sample.Infrastructure**.
